# bash
Collection of bash scripts (including theme)

# theme
Bash theme is a lightweight bash prompt including git information when in a git project folder

Default look is something like:

```
13:50:49 /home/loyen/.bash
master [ CHANGED 1 | ADDED 1 ]
$
```

It is coloured and you can choose colors and strings used in the bash theme file. Source it when done and you're good to go.
